        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There’s absolutely no way we can fully express just how passionate we are about this lasagna, though one of our coworkers breaking his self-imposed no-carbs rule to try a bite (and confess he’d marry anyone who made it for him) might give you an idea.</p>
        <p> Based on the traditional lasagna alla Bolognese from the Emilia-Romagna province in Italy, we grabbed what we loved most about the timeless, classic recipe and simplified it to make it weeknight-friendly.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Onion and garlic</li>
            <li>Tomato Products</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Cheeses</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the meat sauce</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles</li>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving</li>
        </ol>
