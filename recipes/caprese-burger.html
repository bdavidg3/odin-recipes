        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I am always looking for fun flavors to add to a plain burger. I came up with this Caprese burger recipe after having a delicious Caprese salad.</p>
        <p>Be sure to use fresh basil — and the marinated tomatoes are a must!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>4 thick slices tomato</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk balsamic vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour over tomato slices to marinate.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Mix ground beef, tomato paste, basil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Form beef mixture into 4 equal patties.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Top each burger with mozzarella cheese; allow to melt. Serve on hamburger buns with marinated tomato slices.</li>
        </ol>
